            Hey there! I'm Jay, a passionate student from Pune, and soon to be a Software Engineer. I thrive on turning ideas into amazing web apps and mobile apps (using web skills ;p) and love exploring the latest advancements in tech. <br />

            When I'm not coding, you'll find me trekking through scenic trails, hanging out with my friends, binge-watching Netflix, or hitting the gym. I believe in the power of collaboration and am always excited to team up and build some exceptional products.

            Let's create something amazing together!
